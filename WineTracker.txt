Inventory management system for winery production

Record	-intake of raw product (grapes, supplies)
	-operations that consume or transform those (pressing, bottling)
	-physical location of wine within given tank structure
		like Tank1=400L 'riesling', Tank2=2475L 'white blend,
		 Tank3=empty

Would need a database connection but I think its doable (and would look good for the "extra stuff" category)
